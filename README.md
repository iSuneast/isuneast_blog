I set up this blog base on the homework of a OpenCourse offered by Udacity.
https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-cs253/

five star course. I like it.

I will use this blog to record my daily activity.

More features will be added to this site.

Any question? Please feel free to contact me (isuneast # gmail.com).
