I set up this blog base on the homework of a OpenCourse offered by Udacity.
https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-cs253/

five star course. I like it.

I will use this blog to record my daily activity.

More feature will be added to this site.

If you do have any questions, please feel free to send me email (isuneast # gmail.com).
